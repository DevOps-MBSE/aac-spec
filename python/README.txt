PYTHON VERSION COMPATIBILITY:
   Currently, Python version 3.9.13 is required to avoid certain dependency version issues.

pyproject.toml vs setup.py
    Previously, this project was built with dependency information kept in a setup.py script.
    However, the preferred method is to use pyproject.toml to set the project-level options.
    Required modules are kept in the requirements.in file, and then the pip-compile command is
    used to add hashes to the requirements.txt file for enhanced security (see additional
    instructions below).

TO BUILD FROM TERMINAL:
   cd python
   pip install -e .
   python -m build

TO TEST FROM TERMINAL:
   cd python
   pip install -e .
   tox -e py39

To generate a requirements.txt file populated with hashes, use:
   pip install pip-tools
   pip-compile requirements.in --generate-hashes
